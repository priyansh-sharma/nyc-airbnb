# nyc-airbnb
CIS 550 final project

A Node.js application for finding an Airbnb in the quietest (or noisiest!) parts of the city.

## Getting Started

1) Check you have Node installed. Install it if you don't.
2) In one terminal, cd into the /client directory.
3) Type npm install. This will download all the required client-side dependencies. 
4) In a new terminal, cd into /server directory.
5) Type npm install. This will download all the required server-side dependencies.
6) Type npm start to start the server. The server will start listening on port 8081.
7) In your other terminal, type npm start to start the client.
   Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000. If not, enter this link manually.

Note: You may also need to run npm install react-scripts --save if you get an error message that “react-scripts is not recognized as an internal or external command”.
